Welcome!

I am a Lecturer in the [Cyber Security and Privacy Research
Group](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/research/groups/cyber-security-and-privacy/) in
the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/) at the
[University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/). I got my PhD from the University
of St Andrews. Before joining York, I had worked at Imperial College London, the
University of Southampton, and De Montfort University.

I am broadly interested in user-centric systems powered by personal data and
privacy protection in such systems. My current focus is to design and implement
edge-based intelligent systems for smart healthcare in a privacy-preserving
fashion through federated learning.

I am looking for self-motivated students who want to design and implement
real-world systems that can actually reform our lives. If you want to do a PhD
with me and are interested in topics such as usable privacy and security, edge
computing, and privacy-preserving machine learning, please get in touch!
